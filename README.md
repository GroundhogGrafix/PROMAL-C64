# PROMAL-C64
PROgrammer's Microapplication Language

The compiler is included in this project due to it's scarcity. I have included addon's for this compiler that were not written by myself but by people long before Github existed. I have not had an oppurtunity to make much with this compiler yet but I will say it is a fantastic 8-Bit IDE that I highly recommend. I believe it is superior to Power C as well as any other programming environment for 8-bit systems that I have come across yet. The code is C like with some Pascal added in to the mix. If you search for PROMAL Wiki you can read more about it there.
